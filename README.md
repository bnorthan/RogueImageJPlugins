Rogue imageJ plugins - Example Scripts and Plugins for ImageJ/imageJ2

This repository is a place for self contained ImageJ and ImageJ2 plugins, scripts and code snippets.  Some of these will also be integrated into the larger deconvolution project.  Examples include integration of ITK and ImageJ2, and ImageJ2 GPU deconvolution via a JNI wrapper to a pre-existing GPU deconvolution algorithm (YacuDecu).
